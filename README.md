# bioinformatics-and-drug-discovery
In this repository we discuss and share all about the Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery field and here we share codding area as well.


Bioinformatics Project - Computational Drug Discovery Exploratory Data Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In part we will be performing Descriptor Calculation and Exploratory Data Analysis.


Calculate Lipinski descriptors
--------------------------------------
	-> Christopher Lipinski, a scientist at Pfizer, came up with a set of rule-of-thumb for evaluating the druglikeness 
	   of compounds. Such druglikeness is based on the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) that 
	   is also known as the pharmacokinetic profile.

	Lipinski's Rule.
	------------------
		-> Molecular weight < 500 Dalton
		-> Octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) < 5
		-> Hydrogen bond donors < 5
		-> Hydrogen bond acceptors < 10
